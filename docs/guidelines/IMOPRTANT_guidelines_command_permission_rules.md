## Command Permissions
Please see:
Global Permissions: `~/.claude.json`
Project-specific Permissions: `PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/settings.json`

## Work Aggressively
As long as commands are allowed, DO NOT HESITATE TO WORK WITH YOUR DECISION MAKING. NO CONFIRMATION NEEDED AS LONG AS YOU THINK IT WILL CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS.

## Your Understanding Check
Did you understand the guideline? If yes, please say:
`CLAUDE UNDERSTOOD: ~/.claude/guidelines/guidelines_command_permissions.md`
